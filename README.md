===============

Android Libraries API Level 17
Package name: com.masenf.core

This repository is in active development, don't plan to use its public interfaces
as they will likely change in the future. These routines are general enough that
they could apply to many Android applications. As I develop my apps, I may need
to change these libraries at will and make them better.

Feel free to use this library in whole or in part in your projects. If you create 
substantial improvements and want to give back, I'll consider all pull requests.
